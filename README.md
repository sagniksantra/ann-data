## Features

### 1. AI Chatbot

Anndata's AI chatbot, powered by state-of-the-art Gen AI and LLM models, provides farmers with hyper-personalized, real-time advice. It offers guidance on crop care, pest control, and more, making precision farming easily accessible to all.

### 2. Disease Detection

Our platform employs YOLO v8 and a robust Indian scientist-curated dataset to identify crop diseases from images. Early intervention and prevention are the cornerstones of modern agriculture, enabling farmers to detect disease onset before incurring massive losses.

### 3. Marketplace

Anndata disrupts traditional supply chains by connecting farmers directly with consumers through our marketplace. This marketplace empowers farmers to reclaim their rightful profits, providing a reliable and trustworthy platform for selling their livelihood. This approach reduces export and acquisition costs significantly, benefitting both farmers and consumers.

### 4. QnA Forums

We offer an open forum for farmers where they can ask questions related to their specific problems. Farmers can tag their questions, making it easier for other farmers to provide relevant answers. This collaborative community approach fosters knowledge sharing and problem-solving within the farming community.

### 5. Crop Recommendation

Anndata recommends the ideal crops for each unique soil profile using our proprietary Support Vector Classifier model, driven by scikit-learn. By utilizing probabilistic distribution, we provide precise crop suggestions, ultimately increasing the likelihood of a successful harvest.
